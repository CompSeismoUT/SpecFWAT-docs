# Mesh Parameters

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components';

SpecFWAT inherit meshing with `xmeshfem3D` from Specfem3D (Please see [Specfem3D Docs](https://specfem3d.readthedocs.io/en/latest/03_mesh_generation/) in details), but the file can be defined in [`DATA/fwat_params.yml`](parameter) for different simulation type. Different size of elements for different mesh help to saving time consumption in joint FWAT.

`LOCAL_PATH` parameter in `DATA/Par_file` and `Mesh_Par_file` is the path to mesh and databases files. In the joint FWAT, the real path to mesh and databases files will be `{LOCAL_PATH}/{simu_type}`, because of different mesh for different simulation type.
