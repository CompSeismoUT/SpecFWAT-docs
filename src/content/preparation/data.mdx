# Waveform data

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

## File Structure
The waveform data is stored in the `fwat_data/` directory. The waveform data is organized by event, and each event has its own subdirectory `fwat_data/${event_name}/`. The waveform data files are in SAC format, and the file name should be in the format of

- `net.sta.BX?.sac`: in teleseismic and ambient noise tomography;
- `net.sta.BXR.F${gaus}.rf.sac`: in receiver function adjoint tomography;

where `net` is the network code, `sta` is the station code, and `BX?` is the component code (e.g., `BXR` for radial component, `BXZ` for vertical component), which are set in the `DATA/fwat_prams.yml`: `RCOMPS`. The `gaus` is the Gaussian width of the receiver function in 1 bit float format (e.g., 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0), which should be the same as in `DATA/fwat_params.yml`: `F0`.


## SAC Headers

Some SAC headers are required to be set in the waveform data files. The following headers are required:

### For All Simulation Types
- `b`: Beginning time of the waveform data in seconds.
- `baz`: Back-azimuth of the event in degrees.
- `dist`: Epicentral distance in kilometers.

<Callout>
The `dist` dose not need to be set for receiver function adjoint tomography.
</Callout>

### Additional Headers for Teleseismic Tomography
- `t0`: The arrival time of the first P wave in seconds.
