# Sources and Receivers

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components';

The `src_rec/` directory in the `project` contains input files for defining sources and receivers FWAT.

## Source list

The source list is used to define the sources for the FWAT. The source file name should be `sources_${dat_type}.dat`, where `${dat_type}` is the simulation type, such as `noise` for ambient noise tomography, `tele` for teleseismic tomography or `rf` for receiver function adjoint tomography. The source list file contains the following 6 columns:

- `event_name`: The name of the event, which is used to define the source and receiver file name.
- `event_lat`: The latitude or Y coordinate of the event in degrees.
- `event_lon`: The longitude or X coordinate of the event in degrees.
- `event_depth`: The depth of the event.
- `event_buried`: The buried depth of the event.
- `event_weight`: The weight of the event, which is applied to objective function and adjoint source.

```plaintext
MX.ST000 -0.8209138629358446 -0.820465815889 0.0 0.0 1.0
MX.ST001 -0.6212345678901234 -0.621098765432 0.0 0.0 1.0
```

<Callout>
For teleseismic tomography, the `event_lat`, `event_lon`, `event_depth` and `event_buried` are not used due to the definition of back-azimuth and take-off angle of the injected plane wave, but they are required for the source list file format. You can set them to `0.0`.

## Source files

Different simulation types require different source files in the `src_rec/` directory. Below are the source files for different simulation types:

### Ambient Noise Tomography
For ambient noise adjoint tomography, the force solution is used as the source. the source file name should be `FORCESOLTION_${event_name}` and the format is the same as that in Specfem3D.

```plaintext
FORCE  001
time shift:     0.0000
f0:             0.5

component dir vect source E:     0.d0
component dir vect source N:     0.d0
component dir vect source Z_UP:  1.d0
```

### Teleseismic Tomography

The plane wave will be injected into SEM domain for teleseismic simulation, including teleseismic and receiver function adjoint tomography. Frequency-wavenumber (FK) will be used to calculate the injection plane wave. The `FKmodel_${event_name}` file is used to define the FK model for the teleseismic source.

```

## Receiver files

The receiver files are used to define the receivers locations for the FWAT. The receiver file name should be `STATIONS_${event_name}` and the format is the same as that in Specfem3D. The file contains 6 columns: station station, network, latitude, longitude, elevation, and buried depth. Below is an example of the receiver file:

ST001 MX -0.20 0.50 0.00 0.00
